### Four Cheese Pizza Recipe

#### Ingredients:

**For the dough:**
- 2 ¼ teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
- 1 ½ cups warm water (about 110°F or 45°C)
- 3 ½ to 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar

**For the sauce:**
- 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the toppings:**
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup shredded fontina cheese
- 1 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh basil leaves (optional)
- Red pepper flakes (optional)

#### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the dough:**
   - In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until the mixture becomes frothy.
   - In a large bowl, combine 3 ½ cups of flour and the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
   - Stir until a dough forms, then turn it out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until it has doubled in size.

**2. Prepare the sauce:**
   - In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the tomato sauce, tomato paste, minced garlic, oregano, basil, and sugar. Stir well to combine.
   - Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let it cool.

**3. Assemble the pizza:**
   - Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.
   - Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal pieces (for two pizzas). On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece into a 12-inch round.
   - Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet dusted with cornmeal (to prevent sticking).
   - Spread a thin layer of the sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
   - Evenly distribute the mozzarella, fontina, Gorgonzola, and Parmesan cheeses over the sauce.

**4. Bake the pizza:**
   - Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.
   - Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and starting to brown.
   - Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.

**5. Serve:**
   - Garnish with fresh basil leaves and red pepper flakes if desired.
   - Slice and enjoy your delicious Four Cheese Pizza!
