#### Ingredients

**For the Dough:**
- 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F or 45°C)
- 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt

**For the Tomato Sauce:**
- 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Toppings:**
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Various toppings like pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, fresh basil, etc.

#### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Dough:**
1. In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, then sprinkle the yeast on top. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
2. Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine.
3. Gradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough starts to come together.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.

**2. Prepare the Tomato Sauce:**
1. In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Add the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
4. Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside.

**3. Assemble the Pizza:**
1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
2. Punch down the dough and divide it into two portions for two pizzas. Roll each portion into a ball.
3. On a floured surface, roll out one portion of dough into a 12-inch circle.
4. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
6. Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
7. Add your desired toppings.

**4. Bake the Pizza:**
1. If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. Otherwise, place the baking sheet in the oven.
2. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
3. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.

**5. Serve:**
1. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and toppings.
2. Enjoy your homemade pizza!
